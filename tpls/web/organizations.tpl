<h2>ACM SIGGRAPH</h2>
<p>In the span of a little more than 40 years, ACM SIGGRAPH has grown from a handful of computer graphics enthusiasts to a diverse group of researchers, artists, developers, filmmakers, scientists, and other professionals who share an interest in computer graphics and interactive techniques. Our community values excellence, passion, integrity, volunteerism, and cross-disciplinary interaction. We sponsor not only the annual SIGGRAPH conference, but also focused symposia, chapters in cities throughout the world, awards, grants, educational resources, online resources, a public policy program, traveling art show, and the SIGGRAPH Video Review. For more information, see: <a href="http://www.siggraph.org">http://www.siggraph.org</a></p>
<h2>ACM</h2>
<p>ACM SIGGRAPH's parent organization is the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the worlds first and largest computing society. ACM serves as an umbrella organization for information-technology professionals, and ACM SIGGRAPH members may also join ACM. Benefits of adding ACM membership include discounts on cutting-edge magazines, journals, books, and conferences. ACM members may also subscribe to the Digital Library, which contains the archive of ACM-related publications. Computer graphics professionals who join both ACM and ACM SIGGRAPH are eligible for discounted subscriptions to ACM Transactions on Graphics and the Journal of Graphics Tools.
