Abstract 

Near-eye displays project images directly into a viewer\'s eye, encompassing both head-mounted displays (HMDs) and electronic viewfinders. Such displays confront a fundamental problem: the unaided human eye cannot accommodate (focus) on objects placed in close proximity. This talk introduces a light-field-based approach to near-eye display that allows for dramatically thinner and lighter HMDs capable of depicting accurate accommodation, convergence, and binocular-disparity depth cues. Such near-eye light field displays depict sharp images from out-of-focus display elements by synthesizing light fields that correspond to virtual scenes located within the viewer\'s natural accommodation range. Building on related integral imaging displays and microlens-based light-field cameras, we optimize performance in the context of near-eye viewing. Near-eye light field displays support continuous accommodation of the eye throughout a finite depth of field; as a result, binocular configurations provide a means to address the accommodation convergence conflict that occurs with existing stereoscopic displays. This talk will conclude with a demonstration featuring a binocular OLED-based prototype and a GPU-accelerated stereoscopic light field renderer.

Abstract

Colored pattern images appear everywhere; they are used as background and header images in web design, as decorations in games, in clothing and upholstery, and in personal arts and crafts. Choosing colors for a pattern is one way to personalize and enliven the design composition. However, it can be difficult for a beginning artist or enthusiast to effectively explore the large space of possible colorings. In this talk, we look at automatically generating coloring suggestions to help the user through the creative coloring process.

We present a probabilistic factor graph model for automatically coloring patterns. The model is trained on example patterns to statistically capture their stylistic properties. It incorporates terms for enforcing both color compatibility and spatial arrangements of colors that are consistent with the training examples. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, the model can be sampled to generate a diverse set of new colorings for a target pattern. This general probabilistic framework also allows users to guide the generated suggestions via conditional inference or additional soft constraints. We demonstrate results on a variety of coloring tasks, and show a demo vector-art-editing application that incorporates the suggestion engine. Similar techniques may be useful for other domains of graphic art, such as typography and layout.

Abstract

Colored pattern images appear everywhere; they are used as background and header images in web design, as decorations in games, in clothing and upholstery, and in personal arts and crafts. Choosing colors for a pattern is one way to personalize and enliven the design composition. However, it can be difficult for a beginning artist or enthusiast to effectively explore the large space of possible colorings. In this talk, we look at automatically generating coloring suggestions to help the user through the creative coloring process.

We present a probabilistic factor graph model for automatically coloring patterns. The model is trained on example patterns to statistically capture their stylistic properties. It incorporates terms for enforcing both color compatibility and spatial arrangements of colors that are consistent with the training examples. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, the model can be sampled to generate a diverse set of new colorings for a target pattern. This general probabilistic framework also allows users to guide the generated suggestions via conditional inference or additional soft constraints. We demonstrate results on a variety of coloring tasks, and show a demo vector-art-editing application that incorporates the suggestion engine. Similar techniques may be useful for other domains of graphic art, such as typography and layout.

Abstract 

Near-eye displays project images directly into a viewer\'s eye, encompassing both head-mounted displays (HMDs) and electronic viewfinders. Such displays confront a fundamental problem: the unaided human eye cannot accommodate (focus) on objects placed in close proximity. This talk introduces a light-field-based approach to near-eye display that allows for dramatically thinner and lighter HMDs capable of depicting accurate accommodation, convergence, and binocular-disparity depth cues. Such near-eye light field displays depict sharp images from out-of-focus display elements by synthesizing light fields that correspond to virtual scenes located within the viewer\'s natural accommodation range. Building on related integral imaging displays and microlens-based light-field cameras, we optimize performance in the context of near-eye viewing. Near-eye light field displays support continuous accommodation of the eye throughout a finite depth of field; as a result, binocular configurations provide a means to address the accommodation convergence conflict that occurs with existing stereoscopic displays. This talk will conclude with a demonstration featuring a binocular OLED-based prototype and a GPU-accelerated stereoscopic light field renderer.

Abstract

Mermaids and pirates, the Hulk and Iron Man! This talk will describe the behind-the-scenes technology of ILM\'s match-moving and 3D capture system used in recent movies, including The Avengers, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Battleship, as well as new sub-pixel tracking of entire natural environments in Avatar, Star Trek, and The Lone Ranger to create the latest 3D visual effects. 

While Motion Capture is the predominant technology used by film studios, ILM has moved beyond such studio-based technology to do special effects without markers and without multiple high-speed IR cameras.  Instead, many scenes are shot on-site, outdoors, and in challenging environments with the benefit of new interactive computer vision techniques. 

Ronald and Chris will discuss the research and development of the new ILM system, and Jeff will demonstrate its use in production.

Abstract

Colored pattern images appear everywhere; they are used as background and header images in web design, as decorations in games, in clothing and upholstery, and in personal arts and crafts. Choosing colors for a pattern is one way to personalize and enliven the design composition. However, it can be difficult for a beginning artist or enthusiast to effectively explore the large space of possible colorings. In this talk, we look at automatically generating coloring suggestions to help the user through the creative coloring process.

We present a probabilistic factor graph model for automatically coloring patterns. The model is trained on example patterns to statistically capture their stylistic properties. It incorporates terms for enforcing both color compatibility and spatial arrangements of colors that are consistent with the training examples. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, the model can be sampled to generate a diverse set of new colorings for a target pattern. This general probabilistic framework also allows users to guide the generated suggestions via conditional inference or additional soft constraints. We demonstrate results on a variety of coloring tasks, and show a demo vector-art-editing application that incorporates the suggestion engine. Similar techniques may be useful for other domains of graphic art, such as typography and layout.

Sharon Lin is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Stanford University, advised by Pat Hanrahan. Her thesis work focuses on automatically assisting color choice for graphic art by learning from examples. Previously, she has worked on extracting representative color themes from images, and using image search to choose more semantically-meaningful colors for data visualization. She earned a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Washington.

Daniel Ritchie is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Stanford University, where he is advised by Pat Hanrahan. His current research focuses on using probabilistic computation and probabilistic programming languages to generate art, build better design tools, and otherwise improve the creative process. Previously, he earned a B.A. in Computer Science at the University of California at Berkeley and an M.S. in Computer Science at Stanford.

Matthew Fisher received his B.S. in Computer Science at from Caltech, his Ph.D. from Stanford University under a Hertz Fellowship, and is currently a postdoc in Pat Hanrahan\'s lab. He has published on a variety of graphics topics including geometric design, tessellation for micropolygon rendering, and using probabilistic graphical models for example-driven design. His thesis develops approaches for understanding and automatically synthesizing 3D environments from examples.

Summary

Obtaining a light field from real world the can enable many applications, such as post-capture camera control and scene reconstruction. While many light field capture systems have been proposed and built in the lab, the microlens/lenslet-based approach is still the most mature one and already available on the market. However, it is often stated that there is a fundamental tradeoff between spatial and angular resolution of lenslet light field cameras, but there has been limited understanding of this tradeoff theoretically or numerically. This talk will describe a light transport framework for understanding the fundamental limits of light field camera resolution. 
The new framework includes many factors that were not included in existing models. For example, we show that the 4D spatial-angular sensitivity profile of the photosensor must be considered in the performance analysis. The new framework is used to make many predictions that are closer to the observations and contradict existing models. The talk will discuss how the new framework should be considered in designing the light field cameras or processing algorithms.

Abstract

Ray tracing acceleration is coming to a GPU near you!  In this talk, we will discuss the hardware architecture changes that we have made to Imagination’s PowerVR GPU in order to enable ultra-efficient accelerated 3D spatial queries.  Following this, we will explore the roadmap for ray tracing in the coming years, looking at some techniques and use cases for ray tracing today and the applications that become possible with steadily increasing ray tracing performance over time.

Luke Peterson is the Director of Ray Tracing R&D at Imagination Technologies, one of the world’s top three silicon IP companies, providing the key processing blocks needed to create the SoCs (Systems on Chips) that power all mobile, consumer and embedded electronics.  Luke joined Imagination in 2010 with the acquisition of Caustic Graphics Inc., a company he founded along with several other engineers from Apple, to build the next generation GPU.

Gareth Morgan is a Rendering Software Engineer at Imagination Technologies. He has been involved in games and 3D graphics since 1999, starting at Silicon Graphics followed by several games companies including Activision and BAM Studios. Since 2008 he has been working at Caustic / Imagination researching ways to apply ray tracing techniques to games using Imagination\'s ray tracing acceleration hardware.

Ray Tracing Examples
http://www.meetup.com/SV-SIGGRAPH/events/219477868/

Renders from a progressive production renderer running on top of our ray tracing acceleration framework.

A technique for ray traced shadows that is twice as efficient as cascaded shadow maps.

A traditional rasterized game, using ray tracing for selective effects, namely reflection, refraction, and shadowing.

A Global Illumination (GI) technique interpolating between spherical harmonics probes, which are converged in realtime.

Abstract

Ray tracing acceleration is coming to a GPU near you!  In this talk, we will discuss the hardware architecture changes that we have made to Imagination’s PowerVR GPU in order to enable ultra-efficient accelerated 3D spatial queries.  Following this, we will explore the roadmap for ray tracing in the coming years, looking at some techniques and use cases for ray tracing today and the applications that become possible with steadily increasing ray tracing performance over time.

Abstract

What if your mobile phone’s display would correct your vision deficiency instead of your glasses? Light field display technology can assess and correct the user’s vision. In this talk, we discuss a wide range of unconventional applications that are facilitated by light field technology, a novel inexpensive computational display technology. Light field displays are expected to be “the future of 3D displays”, although many believe that the recent hype about stereoscopic 3D displays is over. One reason why the consumers haven’t widely adopted 3D television can be the lack of a unique or useful enhancement of the 2D viewing experience. Wetzstein discusses why it is believed that a new technology - light field displays - delivering an experience that consumers haven’t adopted in the past will work in the future. The talk begins with a short historical review of light field displays and recent trends towards compressive light field display, followed by a discussion of applications in projection systems, vision assessment and correction, wearable displays, and a brief comparison to holography.
